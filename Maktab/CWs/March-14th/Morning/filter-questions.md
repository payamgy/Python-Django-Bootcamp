## Filtering
#### 1. Suppose you have a list of strings representing file names.
 Write a function called `filter_image_files` that takes a list of file names as input and returns a list containing only the names of files with image extensions (e.g., ".jpg", ".png", ".gif"). Use the filter() function along with a lambda function to apply this filtering.

#### 2. You are building a social media analytics tool that needs to filter out spam comments.
 Write a function called `filter_spam_comments` that takes a list of comments as input and returns a list containing only the comments that do not contain any spam keywords (e.g., "buy now", "get rich quick"). Use the filter() function along with a lambda function to apply this filtering.

##### 3. You are developing a search engine that needs to filter out irrelevant search results.
 Write a function called `filter_irrelevant_results` that takes a list of search results as input and returns a list containing only the results that contain at least one of the search keywords. Use the filter() function along with a lambda function to apply this filtering.

```python
def filter_irrelevant_results(search_results, search_keywords):
    # your code here
    pass
```

##### 4. You are working on a data analysis project that involves processing student scores.
 Write a function called `filter_passing_scores` that takes a dictionary of student names and their corresponding scores as input and returns a dictionary containing only the students who have passed (i.e., scored above a certain threshold). Use the filter() function along with a lambda function to apply this filtering.


##### 5. You are building a recommendation system for an e-commerce platform.
 Write a function called `filter_recommended_products` that takes a list of product IDs as input and returns a list containing only the product IDs of items that are highly rated and frequently purchased. Use the filter() function along with a lambda function to apply this filtering.

##### 6. You are developing a content moderation tool for a forum.
 Write a function called `filter_inappropriate_posts` that takes a list of posts as input and returns a list containing only the posts that do not contain any inappropriate language or content. Use the filter() function along with a lambda function to apply this filtering.


##### 7. You are working on a financial analysis project that involves processing stock data.
 Write a function called `filter_profitable_stocks` that takes a dictionary of stock symbols and their corresponding prices as input and returns a dictionary containing only the stocks that have shown consistent profitability over a certain period. Use the filter() function along with a lambda function to apply this filtering.

```python 
stock_data = {
    'AAPL': [230.56, 231.78, 232.9, 234.12, 235.34],
    'GOOGL': [230.56, 231.78, 22.9, 234.12, 235.34],
    'MSFT': [6, 7, 7.6, 7.8, 9]
    }
```
