### Exercise 1:
Write a function called `double_numbers` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list where each number is doubled. Use the `map()` function to apply this function to the list of numbers.
```python 
def double_numbers(numbers):
    # Your code here

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_numbers = double_numbers(numbers)
print(doubled_numbers)  # Output should be: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

### Exercise 2:
Write a function called `capitalize_strings` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list where each string is capitalized. Use the `map()` function to apply this function to the list of strings.

```python 
def capitalize_strings(strings):
    # Your code here

strings = ['hello', 'world', 'python']
capitalized_strings = capitalize_strings(strings)
print(capitalized_strings)  # Output should be: ['Hello', 'World', 'Python']

```

### Exercise 3:
Write a function called `calculate_squared` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list where each number is squared. Use the `map()` function to apply this function to the list of numbers.

```python
def calculate_squared(numbers):
    # Your code here

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = calculate_squared(numbers)
print(squared_numbers)  # Output should be: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Exercise 4:
Write a function called `remove_vowels` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list where each string has its vowels removed. Use the `map()` function to apply this function to the list of strings.
```python 

def remove_vowels(strings):
    # Your code here

strings = ['hello', 'world', 'python']
strings_without_vowels = remove_vowels(strings)
print(strings_without_vowels)  # Output should be: ['hll', 'wrld', 'pythn']

```
### Exercise 5:
Write a function called `find_lengths` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list containing the length of each string. Use the `map()` function to apply this function to the list of strings.

```python
def find_lengths(strings):
    # Your code here

strings = ['hello', 'world', 'python']
lengths = find_lengths(strings)
print(lengths)  # Output should be: [5, 5, 6]
```

### Exercise 6:
Write a function called `check_even_odd` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list where each number is replaced by 'Even' if it's even and 'Odd' if it's odd. Use the `map()` function to apply this function to the list of numbers.

### Exercise 7:
Write a function called `reverse_strings` that takes a list of strings as input and returns a list where each string is reversed. Use the `map()` function to apply this function to the list of strings.

### Exercise 8:
Write a function called `convert_to_binary` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list where each integer is converted to its binary representation as a string. Use the `map()` function to apply this function to the list of integers.

### Exercise 9:
Write a function called `filter_long_words` that takes a list of strings and an integer `n` as input and returns a list containing only the strings with length greater than `n`. Use the `map+

### Exercise 10:
Write a function called `calculate_factorial` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list where each integer is replaced by its factorial. Use the `map()` function along with recursion to apply this
